# conway

Basic implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in ReasonML / React Native

## Installation

`npm install` (I have had a few troubles with Yarn/Reason so keep to npm, but up to you, obviously)

Then, in two separate windows, `yarn watch` - begins the Reason/Bucklescript compiler, and then `yarn start` to begin the React Native packager.
